This directory contains a client for Frosty Functions,
which we use as bridge between EVM and Internet Computer.

The interface is generate with ./generate-did.sh from https://github.com/marceljuenemann/frosty-functions/, and the client is mostly taken from https://github.com/marceljuenemann/frosty-functions/blob/main/src/frosty-ng/src/app/frosty-function-service.ts
